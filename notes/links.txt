Useful Functions for Lists I
len() returns how many elements are in a list.
max() returns the greatest element of the list. How the greatest element is determined depends on what type objects are in the list. The maximum element in a list of numbers is the largest number. The maximum elements in a list of strings is element that would occur last if the list were sorted alphabetically. This works because the the max function is defined in terms of the greater than comparison operator. The max function is undefined for lists that contain elements from different, incomparable types.
min() returns the smallest element in a list. min is the opposite of max, which returns the largest element in a list.
sorted() returns a copy of a list in order from smallest to largest, leaving the list unchanged.
Useful Functions for Lists II
join method
Join is a string method that takes a list of strings as an argument, and returns a string consisting of the list elements joined by a separator string.

new_str = "\n".join(["fore", "aft", "starboard", "port"])
print(new_str)

Our favourite modules
The Python Standard Library has a lot of modules! To help you get familiar with what's available, here are a selection of our favourite Python Standard Library modules and why we use them!

csv: very convenient for reading and writing csv files
collections: useful extensions of the usual data types including OrderedDict, defaultdict and namedtuple
random: generates pseudo-random numbers, shuffles sequences randomly and chooses random items
string: more functions on strings. This module also contains useful collections of letters like string.digits (a string containing all characters which are valid digits).
re: pattern-matching in strings via regular expressions
math: some standard mathematical functions
os: interacting with operating systems
os.path: submodule of os for manipulating path names
sys: work directly with the Python interpreter
json: good for reading and writing json files (good for web work)
We hope you find these useful!
