"""Problem Statement
Given a linked list, swap the two nodes present at position i and j, assuming 0 <= i <= j. The positions are based on 0-based indexing.

Note: You have to swap the nodes and not just the values.

Example:

linked_list = 3 4 5 2 6 1 9
positions = 2 5
output = 3 4 1 2 6 5 9
Explanation:

The node at position 3 has the value 2
The node at position 4 has the value 6
Swapping these nodes will result in a final order of nodes of 3 4 5 6 2 1 9

"""


# Solution
"""
:param: head- head of input linked list
:param: `position_one` - indicates position (index) ONE
:param: `position_two` - indicates position (index) TWO
return: head of updated linked list with nodes swapped
